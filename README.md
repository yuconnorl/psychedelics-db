[Psychedelics Database](https://psychedelics-database.vercel.app/) serves as a comprehensive hub, offering research papers, insights, and educational resources for psychedelics.

This project is back and maintained by **Taiwan Psychedelic Collective**, a group of individuals dedicated to promoting the safe and responsible use of psychedelics, as well as advocating for de-demonizing of these substances. If you are interested in psychedelics or this project, feel free to [join us](https://tinyurl.com/3fr2ddu7)!

This project is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), with [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/) v2 served as data source and content management system, and leverages the power of LLM (e.g. gpt-4o/gemini) for information summarization and data retrieval (mainly with research papers).
